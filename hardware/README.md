Vive Lighthouse Sensor PCB design v1.0 by Pat Daderko (DogP)
 based on Discrete Lighthouse Sensor schematic posted by Alan Yates

This contains the necessary gerber files, as well as PDF documents of the schematics and PCB assembly, and a spreadsheet with the BOM.  Pictures of the PCB (both bare, and assembled) are also included for reference.

The PCB design is 1.3"x0.6", with single sided assembly, and has been assembled and tested to confirm basic functionality (sync pulses and laser sweeps are visible on an oscilloscope).

All parts are currently stocked at Digikey, and equivalent parts are readily available from other distributors.

For ease of ordering, this PCB project (bare PCB only) can be ordered from OSH Park through this shared project: https://www.oshpark.com/shared_projects/YHOUqQiW .
